# Flashcard-Generator

Flashcard-Generator is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows the user to create two types of flash cards: Basic Cards and Close Cards.

After all of the flashcards have been created, the user can then go through all of the flashcards!

This application focuses on the Inquirer node module and node js constructors.
